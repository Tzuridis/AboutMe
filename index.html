  <h2 class="questions"> What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p class="answers"> My favorite hobbies include gaming, watching movies, learning about history, dancing and traveling.</p>
  <h2 class="questions"> What is your dream job?</h2>
    <p class="answers"> My dream job is to one day create an online video game that is on steam, browser and mobile.</p>
  <h2 class="questions"> Why do you want to learn to become a developer?:</h2>
    <p class="answers"> I want to be a developer because I spent most of my time on a computer. I have a lot of ideas of things I want to do but do not have the skills to do them, that is the main reason why I want to become a programmer. I have always liked programming and video games and have created some mods and private servers for various games. Most of that was done with emulators or other various tools that did most of the work for me, so while I was exposed to some languages like javascript and python I did not really learn that much. I know it is entirely possible to create great games with languages like javascript just based off my experience with games like browserquest, pokemon emulators, ragnarok mobile etc. I hope to one day create fun games like <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/andrewmartin/azul-baronis">Azul Baronis</a>. </p>
